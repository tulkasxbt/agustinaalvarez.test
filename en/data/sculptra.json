                "text": "Sculptra is not just an aesthetic procedure: it is a medical treatment that requires evaluation, judgment, and responsibility. Before applying it, it is fundamental to analyze in depth if your skin really needs biostimulation, or if another technique would be more suitable for you. As a doctor, I take time to understand your history, your face, and your expectations. I believe that empathy and ethical commitment are essential: it is not about 'coming and injecting', but about indicating it only when it really adds value to your process. Often, a sincere and close consultation helps define if this treatment is necessary, or if we simply need to accompany, guide, and care without intervening. My commitment is that every decision is based on respect for your health, your naturalness, and your well-being."
