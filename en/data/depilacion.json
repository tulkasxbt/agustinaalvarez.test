In most cases, after completing the treatment (generally between 6 and 8 sessions), hair does not grow back or grows back very reduced and fine. \t\t\t\t<br/><br/> \t\t\t\tHowever, results may vary depending on factors such as skin type, hair color and thickness, and hormonal characteristics of each person. Although many people experience permanent results, in some cases annual maintenance sessions are recommended to prolong results over time. \t\t\t\t<br/><br/> \t\t\t\tTo guarantee a safe and effective treatment, it is fundamental to perform it in a center supervised by specialized doctors, like ours, where we use state-of-the-art equipment and offer personalized attention for each patient."
