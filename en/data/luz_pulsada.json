                "text": "Intense pulsed light (IPL) is a non-invasive medical treatment that uses high-intensity light pulses to treat various skin conditions. It works through the selective absorption of light by specific pigments, such as melanin or hemoglobin, allowing for the removal of spots, treatment of rosacea, and improvement of skin texture. <br>The Harmony XL Pro equipment incorporates advanced technology for greater precision and safety, achieving effective results with lower risk of adverse effects."
