                "text": "The duration of the botox effect is usually 3 to 4 months, although this may vary for each person. After this period, the muscles gradually recover their mobility, and wrinkles reappear. It is important not to apply botox every three months indefinitely, as excessive frequency may decrease its effectiveness over time. It is recommended to plan applications according to the advice of a specialized doctor, who can advise you on the best interval to maintain a natural look."

                "@type": "Answer",
                "text": "Stopping botox use does not cause the skin to worsen. Expression lines return naturally because muscles recover their usual activity. Botox does not generate a cumulative negative effect on the skin, so stopping its application simply means that wrinkles will reappear over time, without this representing a deterioration of the skin's condition."

                "@type": "Answer",
                "text": "Botox and hyaluronic acid fulfill different functions in aesthetics. Botox is ideal for reducing dynamic wrinkles, those generated by gesturing, as it acts by relaxing the muscles. In contrast, hyaluronic acid is used as a filler to restore volume in areas such as cheekbones and lips. The choice between the two will depend on the specific needs of each patient, and they can often complement each other in the same treatment."

                "text": "Botox is safe and recommended for the treatment of dynamic wrinkles when applied by a qualified doctor. The appropriate dose and technique can achieve a natural result, minimizing expression lines without losing facial expression. As with any medical treatment, the experience and skill of the professional are fundamental to the safety of the procedure."

It is not recommended to maintain a fixed schedule every three months without breaks, as constant use could reduce the effectiveness of the treatment. The ideal frequency will depend on the patient's needs and is determined together with the doctor."

                "@type": "Answer",
                "text": "In the long term, botox does not negatively affect the skin or muscles when applied properly. If an appropriate rhythm is respected, botox can help prevent the development of deep wrinkles. However, excessive use can cause muscles to develop some tolerance, which might require a dosage adjustment. Periodic evaluation with the doctor is key to avoiding any potential tolerance and ensuring a natural result."

Some people choose it as early prevention of wrinkles in their twenties or thirties, while others decide to start treatment when they notice more marked lines. The decision of when to start depends on genetics, lifestyle, and each person's desire. A specialist doctor can advise on the right moment, ensuring a personalized approach."
